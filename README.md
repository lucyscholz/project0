My website is a personal site that has a homepage, about, portfolio, and contact page.

All pages have a bootstrap navigation bar at the top.
ALl pages have a footer at the bottom.

Index.html shows a welcome message and then a "featured project" that includes a brief description in the form of an unordered list. It also includes links to a template and the github code for the project. It also includes a .gif that demostrates the projects use.

About.html provides a brief biography ands an unordered list, table, image, and several hyperlinks to external pages.

Portfolio.html uses bootstrap cards to display images and text description for several projects as well as links.

Contact.html uses bootstrap grid to display icons for email, linkedin, and github, as well as links.

stylesheet.scss uses Sass to style the website.

stylesheet.css is created using stylesheet.scss and sass.

There are several images that go in various locations on the website that are also in the directory.

index.html, about.html, and contact.html use bootstraps grid to be responsive to changes in screen size.
